# Continuous Delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

You should follow all steps in this document _before_ performing the Hands-on lab. Pay close attention to product versions, as the version numbers called out in the lab have been tested and shown successful for the lab.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work

     - To complete this lab setup, ensure your account includes the following:

     - Has the [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) built-in role for the subscription you use.

     - Is a [Member](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions#member-and-guest-users) user in the Azure AD tenant you use. (Guest users will not have the necessary permissions.)

2. A [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

3. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

   - A browser, preferably Chrome for consistency with the lab implementation tests.

4. Git for Windows

5. PowerShell

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

You should follow all of the steps provided in this section _before_ taking part in the hands-on lab ahead of time.

### Task 1: Create the Project Repo

In this task, you will create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com) and use `git` to add lab files to a new repository.

1. Create a new repository in GitHub for the lab files.

   - Browse to [GitHub](https://github.com) in your browser and log into your account.

   - Create a new repository.

     - Select the `New` button.

       ![The `New Repository` button in a GitHub profile.](media/b4-task1-step1-1.png "New Repository Button")

     - Provide a name and description for your new repository.

       > **Note**: The suggested name for the repository is `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files`.

     - Select `Private` to make this a private repository.

       ![The `New Repository` creation form in GitHub.](media/b4-task1-step1-2.png "New Repository Creation Form")

     - Select the `Create Repository` button to create the new repository. Once the repository is created, you should see the quick setup notes.

       ![The created repository in GitHub. This should reflect the repository that was created.](media/b4-task1-step1-3.png "Created Repository Page")

       > **Note:** Copy the URL for this repository, as you need it for the next step.

2. Clone the lab repository.

- Create an appropriate workspace folder and navigate to it in a PowerShell terminal.

> **Note**: Suggested name for the workspace folder is `C:\Workspaces\lab`, for example:

```pwsh
C:
mkdir C:\Workspaces
cd C:\Workspaces
mkdir lab
cd lab
```

- You should now be in `C:\Workspaces\lab`. Type the following command and press `<ENTER>`:

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps.git
```

- Within the `lab` folder, create a folder for the GitHub repository created in Step 1 and navigate to it in PowerShell.

```pwsh
mkdir mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
cd mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files
```

- You should now be in `C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files`. The lab files cloned from the Microsoft MCW lab repository should be in `C:\workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-in-azure-devops`. Copy the lab files from the Microsoft MCW lab repository to the new folder.

```pwsh
Copy-Item '..\mcw-continuous-delivery-in-azure-devops\Hands-on lab\lab-files\*' -Destination ./ -Recurse
```

- Initialize the `mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files` folder as a git repository, commit, and submit contents to remote GitHub branch `main` in the lab files repository created in Step 1.

> **Note**: The URI of the lab files GitHub repository created in Step 1 will differ from that in the example below.

```pwsh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Task 2: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

In this task, you will create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to be used for working with Docker images in GitHub automation.

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Create a Personal Access Token as [described here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Ensure the following scopes are checked when configuring your GitHub Personal Access Token:

   - `repo` - Full control of private repositories.
   - `workflow` - Update GitHub Action workflows.
   - `write:packages` - Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry.
   - `delete:packages` - Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry.
   - `read:org` - Read org and team membership, read org projects. This is under the `admin:org` section of scopes.

   ![The configured scopes for a GitHub Personal Access Token.](media/b4-task2-step2-1.png "GitHub Personal Access Token Scope Configuration")

3. Copy the GitHub Personal Access Token somewhere safe and accessible for later use during the lab. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS VALUE TO YOUR REPO!**

   ![The GitHub Personal Access Token. This is a secret value that should be stored somewhere safe and accessible.](media/b4-task2-step3-1.png "Created GitHub Personal Access Token")

### Task 3: Create Azure DevOps Personal Access Token

In this task, you will create an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token to be used in automating Azure DevOps processes.

1. Log in to your existing Azure DevOps account or create a new account on <https://dev.azure.com/>.

   ![The Azure DevOps Portal.](media/b4-task3-step1-1.png "Azure DevOps Portal")

2. Create an Azure DevOps Personal Access Token as [described here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page). For this lab, please ensure your Azure DevOps Personal Access Token is configured with a `Full access` scope.

   > **Note**: A `Full access` scope is not recommended for Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens in live development and production environments. We are only using this scope for this lab.

   ![The Azure DevOps Create Personal Access Token Form.](media/b4-task3-step2-1.png "Create Azure DevOps Personal Access Token")

3. Copy the Azure DevOps Personal Access Token somewhere safe and accessible to you for later use during the lab. **DO NOT COMMIT THIS VALUE TO YOUR REPO!**

   ![The Azure DevOps Personal Access Token created in the previous step.](media/b4-task3-step3-1.png "Created Azure DevOps Personal Access Token")

### Task 4: Create Azure DevOps Project

In this task, you will set up a project in Azure DevOps to be used with the section on continuous deployment in Azure DevOps.

1. Create a `Fabrikam` project in Azure DevOps for use in the lab with the following settings:

   - **Project name**: `Fabrikam`
   - **Visibility**: `Private`

   ![Create a project to get started.](media/b4-task4-step1.png "Created an Azure DevOps project")

   - Under the **Advanced** settings, be sure to select the following values:

     - **Version control**: `Git`
     - **Work item process**: `Basic`

   - Select the **Create project** button.
