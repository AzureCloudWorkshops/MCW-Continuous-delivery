## Overview

In this workshop, we will learn how to setup CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment) with Github actions and Azure! We will start from the ground up from creating a Github repo, creating a .Net MVC project, implement unit tests, pull request templates, tying pull requests to issues, using infrastructure as code (specifically Bicep), and deploying the finished product to Azure! We will also deploy to multiple environments to show the benefit of infrastructure as code and manual approvals to promote releases from environments to environments!

When we finish this workshop you will have a working CI/CD pipeline, that is running automated testing, requesting manual approvals from a dev to prod env, and an API you can hit!

## Prerequisites

There are a few tools we want to make sure we have prior to starting this workshop we want to make sure we have [.Net Core CLI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet) make sure you pick the latest LTS version, a code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [git cli](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com).

## Init Repo

The first step to create a repository on Github we will need to create a GitHub account! You will need to go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create an account. This is a free account that you account that will be used to store our code. If you are not familiar with Github as a whole feel free to dig a little deeper, but my TLDR explanation is Github is a code source repository acquired by Microsoft and the houser of many Open Source Software Projects! We can use Github for free, and can chose to make our repos public or private. There are also many enterprise options for Github too!

Now that you have an account we can create a Github repository! Here you will want to click on
